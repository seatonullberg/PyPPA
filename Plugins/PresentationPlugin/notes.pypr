PyPPAPresentation File (.pypr) Notes:

The general idea is to use Flask in conjunction with a webdriver to make localhost act as an automated
powerpoint style presentation

Ideally, the file can be 'compiled' as an .exe and run anywhere


TAGS:
{META}
* used to provide information on where presentation resources are stored and how to present
-flags:
    -save_location: provide the directory of the compiled presentation
        * defaults to current dir



<frame>
* instantiate a blank frame similar to a PowerPoint slide
* all other tags must be wrapped in an instance of <frame></frame>
* <frame> cannot wrap itself
-options:
    -duration: (int) how long to display the current frame in seconds
        -default: (None) display infinitely long

<voice>
* a selection of text for PyPPA to speak
-options:
    -kind: ('wav', 'txt', 'raw') how to interpret content inside of <voice></voice>
        - 'wav' is used when the content is a path to a wav file
        - 'txt' is used when the content is a path to a text file
        - 'raw' is used when the content is plain text
        -default: 'raw'

<html>
* element used to define the display in the <frame>
-options:
    -kind: ('path', 'raw') how to interpret content inside of <html></html>
        - 'path' is used when the content is a path to an existing html file
        - 'raw' is used when the content should be interpreted as html directly
        -default: 'raw'
